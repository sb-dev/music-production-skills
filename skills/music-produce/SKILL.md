# Music Produce

Produce audio from approved musical direction while preserving approved decisions.

## Scope

Own demos, production realisation, Replicate model routing, model-native music input construction, local continuation/inpainting/refinement where supported, production provenance, deterministic audio processing, technical QC, delivery packaging, and mixes/masters/stems only where the execution path genuinely supports them.

Do not own composition changes unless the workflow explicitly reopens composition.


## Execution prerequisites

For Replicate-backed generation, require the official Replicate peer skills:

```text
find-models
compare-models
run-models
```

and `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`.

If the peer skills are unavailable, report the missing execution dependency. Do not replace them with a custom Replicate client.

Deterministic local audio helpers require Node.js 22+, `ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe`.

## Inputs

Use available music brief, reference analysis, composition, arrangement, existing demo/audio, decision states, delivery requirements, budget, and optional pinned model. Do not require every artifact for simple fast-path tasks.

## Lifecycle and generation policy

Keep these independent:

```text
workflowState: draft | refine | final
generationPolicy: economy | balanced | quality
```

Do not equate lifecycle with model cost.

## Draft / demo

1. Produce only enough fidelity/duration to answer the current production question.
2. Prefer partial sections when they can validate the production direction.
3. Preserve composition and arrangement lineage.
4. Do not over-finish demos.

## Replicate routing

For every generative operation:

1. define the production requirement;
2. define hard capabilities;
3. honour a compatible pinned model if present;
4. otherwise use `find-models`;
5. use `compare-models`;
6. prefer compatible Replicate official models;
7. inspect the selected model's current schema;
8. construct model-native inputs;
9. use `run-models`;
10. store execution provenance.

Capability comes before cost. Do not maintain static pricing, model scores, or a custom Replicate client.

## Prompt / input construction

Express only relevant musical intent, potentially including purpose, tempo/meter, tonal character, instrumentation, structure, section behaviour, lyrics/vocal direction, groove/energy, production aesthetic, duration, reference material, preserved properties, and editable region/properties.

Follow the selected model's native schema rather than a universal request object.

## Refine

1. identify the defect;
2. identify the responsible production decision;
3. identify the smallest affected region/unit;
4. prefer local edit, continuation, inpainting, or reference-conditioned generation when supported;
5. if the current model lacks the capability, rediscover Replicate candidates;
6. use external secondary execution only when explicitly configured and genuinely necessary;
7. verify approved/locked decisions and surrounding material after the change.

Whole-track regeneration requires justification when a smaller repair is possible.

## Deterministic audio tools

Use local scripts and FFmpeg/ffprobe for inspection, trim/extract, concatenation, conversion, technical measurements, and delivery validation.

Do not claim these operations constitute professional creative mixing/mastering.

## Stems

Only label outputs as stems when they are genuine grouped production submixes. If source separation is used by an optional workflow, label the results explicitly as separated estimates.

## Final

1. preserve approved musical direction;
2. satisfy delivery requirements;
3. run technical QC;
4. request/run final music evaluation;
5. retain provenance.

## Do not

- create a custom Replicate SDK;
- build a generic multi-provider router;
- silently switch to an external provider;
- regenerate a whole track for a local defect without justification;
- claim true multitrack/stems when only stereo audio exists;
- use mastering to hide an upstream musical defect.
