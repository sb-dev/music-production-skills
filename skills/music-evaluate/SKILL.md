# Music Evaluate

Evaluate what the current artifact is supposed to prove.

## Scope

Own draft comparison, intent evaluation, composition evaluation, arrangement evaluation, performance/production evaluation where evidence supports it, refinement verification, approved/locked-decision preservation checks, technical audio QC, delivery checks, failure routing, and persistent evaluation reports.

Do not invent observations unavailable from the supplied artifacts.


## Execution prerequisites

Creative evaluation can operate from supplied artifacts and host reasoning without a separate model-provider credential.

Technical audio QC helpers require Node.js 22+, `ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe`.

## Determine artifact and lifecycle

Identify artifact type, workflow state, brief/criteria, parent artifact, requested refinement, decision states, and available evidence. Only apply criteria that the artifact can support.

## Draft evaluation

Check whether the draft answers the intended question, differs materially from alternatives, violates the brief, contains catastrophic musical/technical defects, and is useful to continue.

Do not judge a MIDI composition draft as though it were a final master.

## Refinement evaluation

Check in this order:

1. did the requested change succeed?;
2. were approved and locked decisions preserved?;
3. did the changed region introduce boundary/regression problems?;
4. do prior approvals still hold?

## Final evaluation

Run applicable dimensions: intent, composition, arrangement, performance, production, preservation, technical QC, and delivery.

## Failure routing

For every material finding, identify the most likely owning stage:

- brief / intent;
- composition;
- arrangement;
- performance;
- production;
- editing/refinement;
- mix;
- mastering/technical finishing;
- delivery;
- model/execution.

Then recommend the smallest correction. Do not automatically recommend a more expensive model.

## Open-ended first

For semantic review, inspect the artifact openly before walking a closed checklist. Use the checklist to organise and verify findings rather than assuming it will discover every defect.

## Technical QC

Use deterministic scripts/FFmpeg for objective properties before semantic judgement.

Never claim a technical property was checked if the required dependency or artifact is unavailable.

## Reporting

Produce an `evaluation_report` containing artifact, lifecycle stage, evidence used, findings, severity, owning stage, preservation result, recommended correction, pass/warn/fail recommendation, and checks not run with reasons.

Avoid unsupported universal quality scores.

## Do not

- invent audio observations from text-only inputs;
- declare PASS when a required check did not run;
- treat source-separated audio as native stems;
- route every defect to prompting/model choice;
- silently approve artifacts on behalf of a human when human approval is required.
